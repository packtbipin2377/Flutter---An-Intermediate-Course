## About the Video Course
This is not a beginners course, and you should have a solid grasp of both the Dart language and a beginners understanding of Flutter. This course picks up where the author's Flutter for Beginners course left off. In this course you will learn some of the more complex Flutter widgets, along with using charts, navigation and routing, and state management from building your own to using Redux. Taking the author's existing Dart and Flutter courses before attempting this one is recommended.
